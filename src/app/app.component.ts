1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

Alternatively,

        `# Structured documents

Sometimes it's useful to have different levels
of headings to structure your documents.
Start lines with a \`#\` to create headings.
Multiple \`##\` in a row denote smaller heading sizes.

### This is a third-tier heading

You can use one \`#\` all the way up to \`######\`
six for different heading sizes.

If you'd like to quote someone, use the \`>\`
character before the line:

> Coffee. The finest organic suspension
> ever devised... I beat the Borg with it.

        `There are many different ways to style code with GitHub's markdown.
If you have inline code blocks, wrap them in backticks:
\`var example = true\`.  If you've got a longer block of code,
you can indent with four spaces:

    if (isAwesome){
      return true
    }

GitHub also supports something called code fencing, which allows
for multiple lines without indentation:

\`\`\`
if (isAwesome){
    return true
}
\`\`\`

And if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:

\`\`\`javascript
if (isAwesome){
    return true
}
\`\`\`

//         `GitHub supports many extras in Markdown that help you
// reference and link to people. If you ever want to direct
// a comment at someone, you can prefix their name with
// an @ symbol: Hey @kneath â€” love your sweater!
//
// But I have to admit, tasks lists are my favorite:
//
// - [_x] This is a complete item
// - [ ] This is an incomplete item
//
// When you include a task list in the first comment of an Issue, you will see a helpful progress bar in your list of issues. It works in Pull Requests, too!
